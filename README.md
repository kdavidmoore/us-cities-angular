# Locate Things in Your Area

## Demonstration of Google Maps API, AngularJS, and Node.js

A single-page app that displays selected data on major US cities (sorted by estimated population) on a Google Maps layer. Google Maps API services used include Places and Directions, and autocomplete. The user can search for different types of places in each city by selecting a type of place from the dropdown menu. Markers, along with info windows (where data are available), are displayed for each search result. AngularJS is used to handle interactions between cities data, places data, and the user interface. Angular routing (ngRoute) and a simple Node.js server are used to put the map from front.html and put it on index.html.

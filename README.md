# Locate Services in Your Area

## Demonstration of Google Maps API, AngularJS, and Node.js

A single-page app that displays selected data on major US cities (sorted by estimated population) on a Google Maps layer. Google Maps API services used include Places, Directions, and Autocomplete. The user can search for different types of places (in this case, professional services) in each of these cities, and the search results are displayed as markers, along with info windows (where data are available). AngularJS is used to handle interactions between cities data, places data, and the user interface. Angular routing (ngRoute) and a simple Node.js server are used to put the map from front.html and put it on index.html.
